All notable upstream documentation changes detected by `/update` are documented here.

## 26.4.19

**64 references updated across 17 skills:** agent-sdk-doc, best-practices-doc, ci-cd-doc, cli-doc, cloud-providers-doc, features-doc, getting-started-doc, headless-doc, hooks-doc, ide-doc, mcp-doc, operations-doc, plugins-doc, security-doc, settings-doc, skills-doc, sub-agents-doc

### New
- **Claude Opus 4.7 model support** — `opus` alias now resolves to Opus 4.7 on the Anthropic API; on Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry the alias stays at Opus 4.6 with instructions to pin `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` for 4.7. Requires Claude Code v2.1.111+. Max and Team Premium plans default to Opus 4.7 (features-doc, cloud-providers-doc, ci-cd-doc)
- **`xhigh` effort level** — new effort tier between `high` and `max`, available on Opus 4.7 (default) and the recommended level for most coding/agentic tasks. Falls back to `high` on Opus 4.6/Sonnet 4.6. Interactive `/effort` slider added (features-doc, cli-doc, settings-doc, skills-doc, sub-agents-doc)
- **Auto mode expanded to Max plans** — auto mode now available on Max plans with Opus 4.7; Team/Enterprise/API plans support Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.6, or Opus 4.7. `--enable-auto-mode` flag removed in v2.1.111; auto mode is now in the `Shift+Tab` cycle by default (settings-doc, cli-doc, ide-doc)
- **Plugin monitors** — plugins can declare background monitors in `monitors/monitors.json` that start automatically when the plugin is active. Each monitor runs a shell command for the session lifetime and delivers stdout lines to Claude as notifications. Supports `when` trigger (`always` or `on-skill-invoke:<name>`) and variable substitution (plugins-doc)
- **Plugin dependencies** — `plugin.json` gains a `dependencies` array to declare other plugins a plugin requires, optionally with semver version constraints (plugins-doc)
- **`plugin list` CLI command** — `claude plugin list` lists installed plugins with version, source marketplace, and enable status; `--json` and `--available` flags for programmatic use (plugins-doc)
- **OAuth scope pinning for MCP servers** — `oauth.scopes` in `.mcp.json` pins scopes Claude Code requests during authorization, restricting to a security-team-approved subset (mcp-doc)
- **MCP automatic reconnection** — HTTP/SSE MCP servers that disconnect mid-session are automatically reconnected with exponential backoff (up to 5 attempts). Stdio servers are not reconnected (mcp-doc)
- **`startup()` function in TypeScript SDK** — pre-warms the CLI subprocess before a prompt is available, moving spawn and initialization out of the critical path (agent-sdk-doc)
- **`system/init` event reports plugins** — headless `system/init` event now includes `plugins` and `plugin_errors` arrays; `system/plugin_install` events emitted when `CLAUDE_CODE_SYNC_PLUGIN_INSTALL` is set (headless-doc)
- **Environment caching for cloud sessions** — setup scripts now run once and the filesystem is snapshotted for reuse in later sessions. Cache rebuilds when the setup script or allowed hosts change, or after ~7 days (headless-doc)
- **Cloud session troubleshooting section** — new troubleshooting guidance for session creation failures, Remote Control expiry, and expired environments (headless-doc)
- **Mobile push notifications for Remote Control** — Claude can send push notifications to the Claude mobile app when Remote Control is active. Configure via `/config` → "Push when Claude decides" (features-doc)
- **Session recap** — automatic one-line recap shown when returning to the terminal after a few minutes away. `/recap` command for on-demand summaries. `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_AWAY_SUMMARY` and `awaySummaryEnabled` setting to control (cli-doc, settings-doc)
- **`OTEL_LOG_RAW_API_BODIES` env var** — emits full Anthropic Messages API request/response JSON as OpenTelemetry log events for debugging (operations-doc, settings-doc)
- **`ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H` env var** — replaces Bedrock-only `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H_BEDROCK`; now works on API key, Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry. `FORCE_PROMPT_CACHING_5M` added to override (settings-doc)
- **`VERTEX_REGION_CLAUDE_4_7_OPUS` env var** — override region for Opus 4.7 on Vertex AI (settings-doc)
- **`minimumVersion` setting documented** — floor that prevents auto-updates and `claude update` from installing below a version; usable in managed settings for org-wide minimum (getting-started-doc, settings-doc)
- **`sandbox.network.deniedDomains` setting** — block specific domains even when a broader `allowedDomains` wildcard would otherwise permit them (security-doc, settings-doc)
- **Read-only commands documentation** — built-in set of Bash commands (`ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `find`, `wc`, `diff`, etc.) that run without a permission prompt in every mode. Unquoted globs permitted for read-only commands (settings-doc)
- **Symlink permission rule behavior** — documented how allow and deny rules evaluate both the symlink path and its resolved target (settings-doc)
- **`/fewer-permission-prompts` command** — new skill that scans transcripts and adds an allowlist to project settings (cli-doc)
- **`/focus` command** — toggles a persistent focus view in fullscreen rendering showing last prompt, tool summary, and response (cli-doc, features-doc)
- **`/tui` command** — switch between fullscreen and default renderers mid-session with conversation preserved (cli-doc, features-doc, settings-doc)
- **`/heapdump` command** — writes JS heap snapshot and memory breakdown for diagnosing high memory usage (cli-doc)
- **`/recap` command** — on-demand session summary (cli-doc)
- **`/ultrareview` command** — deep multi-agent code review in a cloud sandbox (cli-doc)
- **`/review` command** — local PR review replacing deprecated plugin-based `/review` (cli-doc)
- **v2.1.114 release (Apr 18)** — crash fix for agent teams teammate permission dialog (operations-doc)
- **v2.1.113 release (Apr 17)** — CLI now spawns native binary via per-platform optional dependency; `sandbox.network.deniedDomains`; fullscreen Shift+arrow selection; `Ctrl+A`/`Ctrl+E` readline behavior; Windows `Ctrl+Backspace`; clickable wrapped URLs; improved `/loop` cancel with Esc; `/extra-usage` and `@`-file autocomplete in Remote Control; improved `/ultrareview` launch; subagent stall detection after 10 minutes (operations-doc)

### Changed
- **Adaptive reasoning generalized** — documentation updated to reference "models that support effort" instead of hardcoding Opus 4.6/Sonnet 4.6. Opus 4.7 always uses adaptive reasoning and does not support a fixed thinking budget. `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ADAPTIVE_THINKING` only applies to Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 (best-practices-doc, features-doc, ide-doc, settings-doc)
- **`ultrathink` keyword reframed** — no longer described as setting effort to high; now described as an in-context instruction telling the model to reason more on that turn (best-practices-doc, features-doc)
- **Session picker reworked** — default view scoped to current worktree; keyboard shortcuts changed to `Ctrl+` prefixes (`Ctrl+A` all projects, `Ctrl+W` worktrees, `Ctrl+B` branch filter, `Ctrl+R` rename, `Space` preview). Name resolution across worktrees documented. `/resume <name>` on ambiguity opens picker with pre-filled search (best-practices-doc, getting-started-doc)
- **`/loop` tasks restored on resume** — `--resume` and `--continue` now restore unexpired `/loop` tasks. "Persistent across restarts" row in the scheduling comparison table updated (features-doc)
- **`/clear` command clarified** — description now explains it starts a new conversation (previous one stays in `/resume`) rather than just "clearing history" (cli-doc)
- **`/compact` description enriched** — mentions it frees context by summarizing, links to compaction rules documentation (cli-doc)
- **`ResultMessage` can have trailing events** — SDK docs now note that `prompt_suggestion` and similar system events can arrive after `ResultMessage`; consumers should iterate to completion rather than breaking on the result (agent-sdk-doc)
- **SDK `setting_sources` default behavior clarified** — default `query()` now loads user and project sources; passing `[]` opts out (previously `[]` was treated as unset in Python SDK ≤0.1.59). Managed policy settings take precedence over programmatic options (agent-sdk-doc)
- **SDK `/clear` not available** — documented that `/clear` is not dispatchable through the SDK; each `query()` already starts fresh (agent-sdk-doc)
- **Bash permission rule `allowed-tools` syntax** — changed from colon-separated `Bash(git:*)` to space-separated `Bash(git *)` form in examples throughout (agent-sdk-doc, settings-doc)
- **`PermissionRequest` hook `allow` behavior** — documented that deny and ask rules are still evaluated after a hook returns `allow`, so hooks cannot override a matching deny rule (hooks-doc)
- **`bypassPermissions` guard rails for hooks** — documented that `setMode` with `bypassPermissions` only takes effect if the session was launched with bypass mode already available (hooks-doc)
- **Auto mode classifier model** — now runs on a server-configured model independent of `/model` selection. Sandbox network requests routed through classifier rather than allowed by default (settings-doc)
- **Auto mode user-stated boundaries** — classifier now treats boundaries stated in conversation ("don't push", "wait until I review") as block signals until lifted. Lost on compaction; use deny rules for guarantees (settings-doc)
- **`dontAsk` mode allows read-only commands** — in addition to `permissions.allow` rules, the read-only command set is now permitted (settings-doc)
- **Subagent `permissionMode` inheritance** — `acceptEdits` now takes precedence like `bypassPermissions` and cannot be overridden by subagent frontmatter (sub-agents-doc)
- **PowerShell tool availability expanded** — now rolling out progressively on Windows (opt-out with `0`); available on Linux/macOS/WSL with `pwsh` on PATH. Sandboxing limitation narrowed to Windows only (cli-doc, settings-doc)
- **npm install reinstated** — npm installation section rewritten as a supported method (was deprecated); native binary delivered via per-platform optional dependency (getting-started-doc)
- **Fast mode scope clarified** — explicitly documented as not available on Opus 4.7 or other models (features-doc)
- **Cloud provider 1M context** — Opus 4.7 added to 1M context support on Bedrock, Vertex. Setup wizards now offer 1M context option when pinning models (cloud-providers-doc)
- **Plugin SSH access** — documented that SSH works for private plugin repositories when host is in `known_hosts` and key is loaded in `ssh-agent` (plugins-doc)
- **Plugin `/plugin` Installed tab** — reorganized with error/dependency plugins first, favorites next, disabled collapsed; `f` to favorite, auto-installed dependencies listed (plugins-doc)
- **Security doc `static analysis` renamed** — reframed as "command parsing for permissions" to clarify it is a permission gate, not a sandbox (agent-sdk-doc)
- **`externalEditorContext` config** — `Ctrl+G` can prepend Claude's previous response as commented context in external editor (settings-doc, cli-doc)
- **`autoScrollEnabled` config** — fullscreen auto-follow can be turned off entirely via `/config` (settings-doc, features-doc)
- Minor wording/formatting updates across ci-cd-doc, skills-doc, sub-agents-doc, security-doc docs

### Removed
- **`--enable-auto-mode` flag** — removed in v2.1.111; auto mode is now in the `Shift+Tab` cycle by default. Use `--permission-mode auto` to start in auto mode (cli-doc)
- **Cowork tab Intel Mac limitation** — removed the note that Cowork requires Apple Silicon; no longer listed as a limitation (ide-doc)

## 26.4.16

**24 references updated across 11 skills:** agent-sdk-doc, best-practices-doc, ci-cd-doc, cloud-providers-doc, features-doc, getting-started-doc, headless-doc, ide-doc, operations-doc, settings-doc

### New
- **`excludeDynamicSections` option on `claude_code` preset** — moves per-session context (working directory, git status, OS, auto-memory paths) out of the system prompt and into the first user message so identical SDK configurations can share a prompt-cache entry across users and machines. Requires `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` v0.2.98+ or `claude-agent-sdk` Python v0.1.58+ (agent-sdk-doc)
- **v2.1.110 release (Apr 15)** — `/tui` command and `tui` setting switch rendering modes in the current conversation; push notification tool lets Claude send mobile pushes when Remote Control is enabled; new `/focus` command and `autoScrollEnabled` config; `Ctrl+O` now toggles verbose transcript only; `/plugin` Installed tab reorganized; `/doctor` warns on MCP servers defined in multiple scopes with different endpoints; SDK/headless sessions honor `TRACEPARENT`/`TRACESTATE` for distributed tracing; recap now enabled for telemetry-disabled setups (Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry); plus many bug fixes (operations-doc)
- **v2.1.109 release (Apr 15)** — extended-thinking indicator now shows a rotating progress hint (operations-doc, best-practices-doc)
- **`CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` env var** — set automatically to `true` in cloud sessions; read from hooks/setup scripts to detect cloud environments (settings-doc)
- **`CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE_SESSION_ID` env var** — set automatically in cloud sessions to the current session ID; use to construct links back to the session transcript (settings-doc, headless-doc)
- **`CLAUDE_CODE_TMUX_TRUECOLOR` env var** — set to `1` to allow 24-bit truecolor output inside tmux (bypasses the default 256-color clamp when `$TMUX` is set) (settings-doc)
- **Pre-fill sessions via query parameters** — `claude.ai/code` URL now accepts `prompt` (aka `q`), `prompt_url`, `repositories` (aka `repo`), and `environment` parameters to prefill a new web session (headless-doc)
- **Link cloud artifacts to sessions** — documented pattern for constructing `https://claude.ai/code/${CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE_SESSION_ID}` links in PR bodies, commits, and generated reports (headless-doc)
- **Spend-cap troubleshooting for Code Review** — new section documenting that reviews are skipped and a comment is posted when the org's monthly spend cap is reached; resumes at next billing period or when admin raises the cap (ci-cd-doc)

### Changed
- **Cost tracking reframed as client-side estimate** — added a prominent warning that `total_cost_usd` and `costUSD` are local estimates computed from a bundled price table, not authoritative billing data. Direct users to the Usage and Cost API or Claude Console for invoice-accurate spend. Language updated throughout SDK, `/cost`, statusline, and Code Review analytics docs (agent-sdk-doc, features-doc, operations-doc, ci-cd-doc)
- **`REVIEW.md` significantly expanded** — rewritten to emphasize that `REVIEW.md` is injected as highest-priority instructions into every review agent (vs. `CLAUDE.md` which is treated as project context and flagged as nits). New sections document tunable areas: severity calibration, nit-volume caps, skip rules, repo-specific checks, verification bar, re-review convergence, and summary shape. `@` import syntax is not expanded (ci-cd-doc)
- **Code Review findings now include summary in review body** — previously documented as inline-only (ci-cd-doc)
- **Routines GitHub triggers narrowed** — supported event categories reduced from ~17 (push, issues, checks, workflows, etc.) to just Pull request and Release. Added documentation of filter operators (equals, contains, starts with, is one of, is not one of, matches regex) and clarified that `matches regex` tests the entire field, not a substring (features-doc)
- **JetBrains diff tool config** — `/config` diff tool setting now documented as `auto` for IDE or `terminal` to keep diffs in the terminal (ide-doc)
- **`network.allowUnixSockets` is macOS-only** — clarified that on Linux/WSL2 the seccomp filter cannot inspect socket paths, so `allowAllUnixSockets` is the only way to permit Unix sockets there (settings-doc)
- **Install configurator added to overview page** — the interactive install configurator component (previously only on quickstart) is now also on the overview page; default-surface A/B test added; handoff card redesigned with product taglines (getting-started-doc)
- Minor wording/formatting updates across agent-sdk-doc, best-practices-doc, cloud-providers-doc, operations-doc what's-new digests (link paths updated from `/en/` to `/docs/en/`)

## 26.4.15

**New reference `claude-code-routines.md`** added to `features-doc` — first-class doc for cloud-hosted Claude Code automation, replacing the old `web-scheduled-tasks.md`.

**New reference `claude-code-whats-new-2026-w15.md`** added to `operations-doc` — Week 15 (Apr 6–10) digest covering Ultraplan, the Monitor tool, terminal `/autofix-pr`, and `/team-onboarding`.

**108 references updated across 19 skills:** agent-sdk-doc, agent-teams-doc, best-practices-doc, ci-cd-doc, cli-doc, cloud-providers-doc, features-doc, getting-started-doc, headless-doc, hooks-doc, ide-doc, mcp-doc, memory-doc, operations-doc, plugins-doc, security-doc, settings-doc, skills-doc, sub-agents-doc

### New
- **Routines** — new cloud-hosted automation page documents saved Claude Code configurations (prompt, repos, connectors) that run on Anthropic-managed cloud infrastructure. Each routine can combine Scheduled, API, and GitHub triggers; managed at `claude.ai/code/routines` or via `/schedule` in the CLI. Research preview on Pro/Max/Team/Enterprise plans with Claude Code on the web enabled. Replaces the removed `web-scheduled-tasks.md` page (features-doc)
- **`minimumVersion` setting** — prevents the auto-updater from downgrading below a specific version; automatically set when switching to the stable channel and choosing to stay on the current version. Used with `autoUpdatesChannel` (settings-doc)
- **`viewMode` setting** — default transcript view mode on startup: `"default"`, `"verbose"`, or `"focus"`. Overrides the sticky `Ctrl+O` selection when set (settings-doc)
- **v2.1.108 release (Apr 14)** — `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H` env var opts into 1-hour prompt cache TTL on API key, Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry (deprecates `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H_BEDROCK`); `FORCE_PROMPT_CACHING_5M` forces 5-minute TTL; new `/recap` command provides context when returning to a session (configurable in `/config`, `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_AWAY_SUMMARY` to force with telemetry disabled); model can now discover built-in slash commands like `/init`, `/review`, `/security-review` via the Skill tool; `/undo` is now an alias for `/rewind`; `/model` warns before switching mid-conversation; `/resume` picker defaults to current-directory sessions with `Ctrl+A` to show all; server rate limits now distinguished from plan usage limits; startup warning when prompt caching is disabled via `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING*` (operations-doc)
- **v2.1.105 release (Apr 13)** — `path` parameter added to the `EnterWorktree` tool to switch into an existing worktree; `PreCompact` hook can now block compaction by exiting with code 2 or returning `{"decision":"block"}`; plugins can declare a top-level `monitors` manifest key that auto-arms background monitors at session start or on skill invoke; `/proactive` is now an alias for `/loop`; stalled API streams now abort after 5 minutes of no data and retry non-streaming; skill description listing cap raised from 250 to 1,536 characters with a startup warning for truncation; `WebFetch` strips `<style>`/`<script>` contents; stale agent worktree cleanup now removes worktrees whose PR was squash-merged; MCP large-output truncation prompt gives format-specific recipes (e.g. `jq` for JSON) (operations-doc)
- **Command hooks `shell` field** — accepts `"bash"` (default) or `"powershell"`; setting `"powershell"` runs the command via PowerShell on Windows without requiring `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL` (hooks-doc)
- **`PreCompact` hooks can block compaction** — exit 2 or `{"decision":"block"}` now halts compaction; blocking proactive compaction skips it, but blocking a recovery-from-limit compaction surfaces the original context-limit error (hooks-doc)
- **`SessionEnd` hooks 1.5s default timeout** — automatically raised to the highest per-hook `timeout` configured in settings files, up to 60 seconds; plugin-provided hook timeouts don't raise the budget; override with `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSIONEND_HOOKS_TIMEOUT_MS` (hooks-doc, settings-doc)
- **Live skill change detection** — adding, editing, or removing a skill under `~/.claude/skills/`, the project `.claude/skills/`, or a `.claude/skills/` inside an `--add-dir` directory now takes effect within the current session without restarting. Creating a top-level skills directory that didn't exist at session start still requires a restart (skills-doc)
- **`CLAUDE_CODE_ADDITIONAL_DIRECTORIES_CLAUDE_MD` env var** — set to `1` to load `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/*.md`, and `CLAUDE.local.md` from `--add-dir` directories; off by default (settings-doc)
- **`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_VIRTUAL_SCROLL` env var** — disables virtual scrolling in fullscreen rendering so every transcript message is rendered. Use when scrolling shows blank regions (settings-doc)
- **`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` env var** — override the context window size for the active model. Only takes effect when `DISABLE_COMPACT` is also set. For routing through `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to a model whose context window doesn't match its built-in size (settings-doc)
- **`CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_PROMPT_HISTORY` env var** — set to `1` to skip writing prompt history and session transcripts to disk; sessions don't appear in `--resume`, `--continue`, or up-arrow history. Now the recommended way to disable transcript writes in interactive mode (settings-doc)
- **Streaming idle watchdogs** — `CLAUDE_ENABLE_BYTE_WATCHDOG` force-enables/disables the byte-level idle watchdog (on by default for Anthropic API, minimum 5 minutes); `CLAUDE_ENABLE_STREAM_WATCHDOG` enables the event-level watchdog (off by default, required for Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry); `CLAUDE_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` configures the timeout (settings-doc)
- **`OTEL_LOG_TOOL_DETAILS` env var** — set to `1` to include tool input arguments, MCP server names, and tool details in OpenTelemetry traces and logs; disabled by default to protect PII (settings-doc)
- **`VERTEX_REGION_CLAUDE_4_5_OPUS` and `VERTEX_REGION_CLAUDE_4_6_OPUS` env vars** — override Vertex AI region for Claude Opus 4.5 and 4.6 (settings-doc, cloud-providers-doc)
- **`ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION_SUPPORTED_CAPABILITIES` env var** — declare capabilities for custom model options (see Model configuration) (settings-doc)
- **`/resume` picker cross-worktree support** — now shows interactive sessions from the same git repository including all worktrees; selecting a session from another worktree resumes it directly without switching directories first. `claude --resume` also accepts custom names set with `--name` or `/rename` in addition to session IDs (best-practices-doc)
- **MCP `http` transport rename** — `--transport streamable-http` is now `--transport http` in `claude mcp add` examples (mcp-doc)

### Changed
- **`cleanupPeriodDays` setting description** — updated to recommend the new `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_PROMPT_HISTORY` env var for disabling transcript writes in interactive mode; previously only `--no-session-persistence` / `persistSession: false` were suggested and only worked in non-interactive mode (settings-doc)
- **Scheduling comparison tables** — every "Cloud scheduled tasks" link/reference across docs now points to `/en/routines` instead of the removed `/en/web-scheduled-tasks` page; scheduling-option comparison tables rewritten to use "Routines" as the cloud option (features-doc, best-practices-doc)
- **Agent SDK examples** — minor wording tweaks in overview/permissions/modifying-system-prompts code samples (agent-sdk-doc)
- Minor formatting/whitespace updates and removal of the `<AgentInstructions>` feedback block across most reference files (all skills)

### Removed
- **`web-scheduled-tasks.md` reference** — removed from `features-doc`; superseded by the new `routines.md` page (features-doc)

## 26.4.11

**New skill `agent-sdk-doc`** — 29 references covering the Claude Agent SDK (overview, quickstart, agent loop, Claude Code features, cost tracking, custom tools, file checkpointing, hooks, hosting, MCP, migration guide, modifying system prompts, observability, permissions, plugins, python, secure deployment, sessions, skills, slash commands, streaming output, streaming vs single mode, structured outputs, subagents, todo tracking, tool search, typescript, typescript v2 preview, user input).

**80 references updated across 18 existing skills:** agent-teams-doc, best-practices-doc, ci-cd-doc, cli-doc, cloud-providers-doc, features-doc, getting-started-doc, headless-doc, hooks-doc, ide-doc, mcp-doc, memory-doc, operations-doc, plugins-doc, security-doc, settings-doc, skills-doc, sub-agents-doc

- **Interactive "Sign in with Bedrock" and "Sign in with Vertex AI" wizards** — new login-screen flows configure AWS/GCP auth, region, credential verification, and model pinning; `/setup-bedrock` and `/setup-vertex` reopen them later (cloud-providers-doc, cli-doc)
- **Startup model checks on Bedrock and Vertex** — pinned and default models are verified at startup with prompts to update or fall back when unavailable; Foundry has no equivalent check and surfaces errors instead (cloud-providers-doc, features-doc)
- **`ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL_AWS_REGION` for Bedrock Mantle** — pin the small/fast model to a specific AWS region (cloud-providers-doc)
- **Fullscreen focus view** — Ctrl+O in fullscreen now cycles normal → transcript → focus view, which shows the last user prompt plus one-line tool summaries with diffstats and the final response (features-doc, cli-doc)
- **`Scroll` keybinding context** — new context exposes rebindable `scroll:lineUp/lineDown/pageUp/pageDown/top/bottom/halfPage*/fullPage*` and `selection:copy/clear` actions for fullscreen mode (cli-doc)

- **`claude setup-token` long-lived tokens** — prints a `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` for CI and scripts without saving it; requires a Claude subscription (cli-doc, getting-started-doc)
- **`/loop` dynamic and maintenance modes** — omit the interval to let Claude pick a cadence between 1m and 1h, omit the prompt to run a built-in maintenance loop, and customize behavior with `.claude/loop.md` or `~/.claude/loop.md` (25,000 byte cap) (features-doc)
- **Remote Control `--spawn=session` single-session mode** — rejects additional connections once the first client attaches (features-doc)

- **`/team-onboarding` command** — new onboarding flow surfaced in the changelog (operations-doc)
- **Plugin manifest `skills` field** — declares `<name>/SKILL.md` skill directories alongside the legacy flat `commands/` field (plugins-doc)
- **Auto-fix pull requests from the terminal** — `/autofix-pr` now works from a local Claude Code session, not just the web (headless-doc)
- **Local repo bundling to cloud sessions** — non-GitHub repos can be uploaded directly from the terminal via `CCR_FORCE_BUNDLE`, with fallbacks for size and branch state (headless-doc)
- **"What survives compaction" table** — documents system prompt, CLAUDE.md, rules with `paths:`, nested CLAUDE.md, invoked skills, and hook behavior through compaction, with a 5,000-token-per-skill and 25,000-token total skill budget (features-doc)
- **"Skill content lifecycle" and "When to create a skill" guidance** — invoked skills are re-attached after compaction, filled from most recent, within the same 5K/25K budgets (skills-doc)

- **CLAUDE.md HTML comments hidden from auto-injection** — `<!-- ... -->` comments no longer visible to Claude when CLAUDE.md is auto-injected; still visible via Read tool (operations-doc)
- **Upstream changelog updated** — new release with `ExitWorktree` tool, `/plan` description argument, `/copy` file-write shortcut, effort level simplification, CLAUDE.md HTML comment hiding, bash parser rewrite, ~510 KB bundle reduction, prompt cache fix reducing input costs up to 12x, and 30+ bug fixes including sandbox permission issues, voice mode stability, worktree isolation, and parallel tool call error handling (operations-doc)

### New
- **`WorktreeCreate` hook event** — replaces default git worktree behavior for non-git VCS (SVN, Perforce, Mercurial); hook prints the created worktree path on stdout (hooks)
- **`WorktreeRemove` hook event** — cleanup counterpart to `WorktreeCreate`; fires at session exit or when a subagent finishes; receives `worktree_path` in input (hooks)
- **Subagent worktree isolation** — subagents can use `isolation: worktree` in frontmatter for parallel conflict-free work; worktrees auto-clean when subagent finishes without changes (best-practices)
- **`claude agents` CLI command** — lists all configured subagents grouped by source without starting an interactive session (cli, sub-agents)
- **`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT` env var** — set to `1` to hide 1M model variants from the model picker; useful for compliance environments (features, settings)

- **GitHub PR monitoring with auto-fix and auto-merge** — CI status bar in Desktop shows check results; toggle auto-fix to have Claude fix failing checks, or auto-merge to squash-merge when all checks pass (ide)
- **Code review in diff view** — "Review code" button in diff toolbar asks Claude to evaluate diffs and leave inline comments on compile errors, logic bugs, and security issues (ide)
- **Preview server configuration reference** — full `.claude/launch.json` schema: `runtimeExecutable`, `runtimeArgs`, `port`, `cwd`, `env`, `autoPort`, `program`, `args` fields with examples for Next.js, monorepos, and Node.js scripts (ide)

- **Desktop notifications guide** — new section on setting up OS-native notifications via the `Notification` hook event (best-practices)

### Changed
- **Worktrees documentation rewritten** — manual `git worktree` workflow replaced with first-class `--worktree` flag; old multi-step guide moved to "manual" subsection (best-practices)
